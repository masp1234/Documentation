<h2>NodeJS</h2>

<p>Nodejs is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that makes it possible to run javascript without needing a browser. This makes it possible to create backend services and console applications etc.</p>

<h2>Node Package Manager</h2>

<p>
    When you install the NodeJS runtime environtment, you also get a tool called Node Package Manager, shortened to npm.
    Npm makes it easy to handle dependencies. To install a package (dependency), you just write something like "npm install express". You can shorten the "install" to "i" if you want. 
<p>
    Here is an example where the module "express" is installed with a specific version. If you omit the version, you will get the latest version by default
</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            npm i express@4.17.2
        </code>
      </pre>

</p>

<h2>Package.json and package-lock.json</h2>

<p>
    Installing a module will create two json files for you and one folder. The 2 files are called "package.json" and "package-lock.json", and the folder is called "node_modules". The "package.json" file contains metadata about your NodeJS project and also all the dependencies that are used in the project.
</p>
<p>
    The file "package-lock.json" contains the exact versions of all the dependencies in the project, as well as the dependencies of your dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    The "node_modules" folder is where all the installed dependencies are located.
