<h2>Server-side rendering</h2>
<p>Server-side rendering is where you construct the page on the server before you send it to the client.</p>

<h3>Pros and cons</h3>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Good for SEO, since it makes it easier for search engines to index your site's pages.</li>
    <li>Better for people with slow connections, since the server constructs the page, instead of delegating the job to the browser.</li>
    <li>Faster initial load.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Slower page loading after the first page compared to client-side rendering.</li>
    <li>A lot of stress on the server, since you are handling all the rendering server-side.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Client-side rendering</h2>
<p>Client-side rendering is where you send a barebones html page and some JavaScript that will render the rest of the content.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons</h3>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Less strain on the server, since the client handles the rendering.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    
</ul>
